        <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability for the neurons in your brain to make new connections and reorganize. This is a key process in effective learning, as neural adaptation is the process by which new information is retained. It was at one point thought only to occur during childhood, but it has now been discovered that neuroplasticity is retained through adulthood in many aspects.</p>

        <p>Web design is like a house. HTML is the foundation and the walls. It’s the base structure, but it’s not exactly functional or helpful in many contexts – not really a house that’s fun to live in. CSS is the paint, the art on the walls, the carpet – it’s pretty and can sometimes be helpful, but it’s also not dynamic or functional.</p>

        <h2>CSS: Getting in the right position</h2>

      <div id="post-content">
        <p>Positioning CSS elements can be a major headache. The browser has <i>ideas</i> about where things should go, and… well, it’s trying it’s best. Often the best course of action is to just tell it where to put things on the webpage. But there’s a lot of ways of doing that, and picking the right one at the right time can save you from finding fun formatting surprises later on in designing your page.
          The default position for an element is static. That just means “it goes where it goes”. That’s boring, so lets skip to the interesting ones.</p>
