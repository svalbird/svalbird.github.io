        <h2>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset – How to keep growing</h2>

          Neuroplasticity is the ability for the neurons in your brain to make new connections and reorganize. This is a key process in effective learning, as neural adaptation is the process by which new information is retained. It was at one point thought only to occur during childhood, but it has now been discovered that neuroplasticity is retained through adulthood in many aspects.
          <br>There are some simple principles which can improve neuroplasticity which can be used for effective learning.
        <ul>
          <li>Repetition and perseverance – Doing something consistently and ensuring it is done regularly is key to allowing for neural growth and organisation to occur for a skill. It’s worth doing something each day, even if it’s only for a short time at times, to reinforce those neural connections.</li>
          <li>Intensity and specificity – Learning new things and pushing skills in more difficult areas leads to more effective neuroplasticity behaviour. It’s worth pushing what you know and trying something difficult to maintain and grow your skills.</li>
          <li>Salience and interference – Doing things that are meaningful and maintaining good habits allows for more effective skill growth. It’s important to try and apply your knowledge to something you’re passionate or interested in, and it’s important to keep good habits around learning (sleep, taking breaks etc.) to maintain neuroplasticity.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>A useful source I found for these is the <a href="https://www.cfimove.org/10-principles-of-neuroplasticity-part-1/">Center for Independence</a>, which helps kids with cerebral palsy. Thanks to them for helping me understand neuroplasticity.
        <br>A growth mindset is a particular approach to learning which assists in learning new skills. In short, it is a mindset which focuses more on trying to learn and grow continually, even if it’s hard or sometimes you fail. This is opposed to the static mindset, which is when knowledge and skills are considered innate, and thus there is less focus on learning and more on looking competent.
        <br>What’s surprising to me is that in research it dawned on me how there are many things where I have a static mindset. I think this is related to the Dunning-Kruger effect – when you don’t know anything about a subject, you feel like there’s so much to learn. If you know some of a subject, you feel skilled and like you know a large amount of the subject, even if you don’t. If you actually know a lot about a subject, you have a greater understanding and respect for the subject, and you go back to feeling like there’s so much to learn. 
        <br>It’s easy to slip into that static mindset if you’re basically competent at something, and I feel that with things I do, like cooking. It’s important to push ourselves out of that mindset, and I think a good approach is to leave our comfort zone and try to appreciate the breadth and depth present. In my cooking, I’ve started doing more vegetarian meals, and it’s a whole new world of things I didn’t know!  
        <br>In terms of my learning journey, I need to push myself into new, difficult areas. Right now, going through the basics, I feel in my comfort zone as someone familiar with coding. That’s why I’m also pursuing other projects during my study, to try and learn and grow effectively (right now I’m learning C# through Unity!).
        <br>Mindset Works has a great resource for this type of mindset <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">here</a>.
        <br>Overall, the key takeaways for my learning plan are to:
          <ul>
            <li>Push myself to learn new things. This could be coding, or this could be in terms of teamwork and self-growth.</li>
            <li>Keep exploring and learning to encourage a growth mindset. Finding applications or contexts that are exciting to me are a great way of doing that (Using Unity and video games to learn C# is an example)</li>
          </ul>
