          <b><li>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</li></b>
          <br>I’ve learned that it’s important to keep an effective balance in my learning mindset – to both appreciate myself and the work I’ve put in, as well as be aware of how enormous and complex fields of study can be, and to use that as a curiosity motivator to keep learning and growing, as opposed to being confident in ability and stagnate, or to be intimidated by my lack of knowledge and give up.
          <b><li>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</li></b>
          <br>Values are key in identifying what areas I’m interested in and where I need to develop. I can use that interest and passion to drive my learning – perhaps through relevant case studies or by finding out more about current events. It’s important to identify our values in programming as they shape the code we make without us even knowing – this can shape our approach to solving problems or what a “problem” even is in the first place.
          <br>Empathy is important in driving forward passion and facilitating the learning of others, which are effective learning tools. Empathy is important in programming as our empathy shapes and informs our code. What do our users want? How would they interact? What is the feedback we’re getting about this feature? All are critical, and all are based in empathy.
          <br>Self-awareness is important in learning as it allows us to consider where to build our skills next, and appreciate how far we’ve come. Often the difficult parts are the important aspects to work on, and that can only be understood with a healthy amount of self-awareness. In programming self-awareness informs our problem solving and our approach. Having others check our code and method of doing things is critical in effective coding.
          <b><li>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li></b>
          <br>How much it’s improved my approach to solving programming problems, as opposed to just learning more technical aspects of web coding.
          <b><li>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li></b>
          <br>Effectively considering my approach to problems, and using tools like healthy sleep patterns and taking breaks, which had massive impacts on my work overall.
          <b><li>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</li></b>
          <br>Software development is a role where learning continues through an entire career. By giving us these tools and skills, you’re setting us up to not just be able to program with current languages and techniques, but to go on to learn and develop in our careers so we can be effective continually.
          <b><li>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</li></b>
          <br>It doesn’t feel like a waste of time as it’s a core aspect of going to specialised training course. If I wanted to just learn React and JQuery, there are so many online courses I could take for free that could do that. The key skills Dev Academy offers, to me, are the softer skills, with learning skills and collaboration being the key parts of that.
