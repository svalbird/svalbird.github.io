          Web design is like a house. HTML is the foundation and the walls. It’s the base structure, but it’s not exactly functional or helpful in many contexts – not really a house that’s fun to live in. CSS is the paint, the art on the walls, the carpet – it’s pretty and can sometimes be helpful, but it’s also not dynamic or functional.
          <br>Javascript is like the appliances and furniture. It needs all that structure and can interact with it (like changing the color of the light bulbs). It’s what you need to do stuff and live in the house, it’s very flexible and useful.
          <br>Control flow is just the order a program runs in – top to bottom. It’s like a to do list – you go down one by one. Sometimes this can cause issues, like when you accidentally have “put the roast chicken in the oven” on your list and immediately afterwards have “clean the oven”. Not really gonna work.
          <br>Loops are when you repeat a task, changing something about it each time. Like vacuuming – you go forward, then back, over and over again, but how far forward and how far back changes each time. 
          <br>The DOM (document object model) is just a way for Javascript interacts with the website, by representing everything in a website as a different object or property or function. It’s how you describe in Javascript what a paragraph or picture or anything else is, and then manipulate that.
          <br>Arrays are like a list of stuff, like [apple, orange, banana]. You can just refer to the list with an index (0, 1, 2), because its ordered. Objects are things that have properties, like a ball may have bouncyness and color as its properties. These aren’t ordered by default, so you have to refer to the property directly, like ball.color.
          <br>Functions are just a list of instructions that can be referred to if needed. If you’re making soup and it says “dice the carrots”, you probably don’t go “How do I do that” even though you can consider dicing a carrot to be a bunch of steps (cut longways, cut down the carrot..). We can consider that a function – a series of instructions that can be referred to without needing to spell out them explicitly every time.
