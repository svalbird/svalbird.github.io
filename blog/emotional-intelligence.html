          <br> Emotional intelligence is a skill in which you can manage and interpret your own emotions and the emotions of others. This is a very key skill in everyday life, as well as in professional settings.
          <br>Key areas of emotional intelligence are:
          <ul>
            <li>Understanding and managing your own emotions</li>
            <li>Having confidence in yourself, but understanding your limitations and strengths</li>
            <li>Understanding the feelings of others, and being effectively empathetic</li>
            <li>Accepting responsibility for mistakes, and being understanding of the mistakes of others</li>
            <li>Understanding and developing areas of personal growth</li>
          </ul>
          <br>Emotional quotient (EQ) is different from IQ in that it is a personal social skill, and while problem-solving and interpretive skills can help, there is a lot of focus on self-improvement and acceptance, as well and understanding and empathising with others, which often has no easy answers. Leaders and good team players have higher EQs.
          EQ is important because these emotional reasoning skills are critical in teamwork and in solving many problems. Sometimes, in design, empathizing with your users can lead to good and accessible design.
