          This is my learning plan for Bootcamp.
          <ol>
            <b><li>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</li></b>
            <br>My long term goal is to work as a software developer. After struggling to find work I’m truly passionate about, I knew that software development was the direction I wanted to go, with a focus on problem solving, creative thinking, and effective collaboration. I would love to have a position as a developer, especially if it were integrated with some of my other qualifications or skills as a chemical engineering graduate and someone with experience in laboratory and legal settings.
            <b><li>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</li></b>
            <br>My biggest strengths will be my ability to pick up new complex topics very fast. I enjoy using this to try novel ways of solving problems and develop my skillset, and I hope to empower others with things I’ve picked up and will pick up.
            <br>My limitations is my inexperience in problem solving with others. Many of my roles were quite independent or structured in a non-collaborative way, which means I need to get more used to working with others and collaborating.
            <b><li>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</li></b>
            <br>Getting to know others and effective collaboration in problem solving will be my biggest challenge. I can be quite reserved, and I haven’t picked up the skills to effectively compartmentalise and collaborate to solve problems with others.
            <b><li>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li></b>
            <br>Getting to know others, and figuring out how to problem solve as a team will be key skills I’m aiming to work on.
            <b><li>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li></b>
            <br>I expect open, honest communication. If there is an issue or problem, I expect to hear from facilitators and other staff what’s happening or what solutions there may be. I expect fairness and consideration, and I expect feedback on the content or assignments to be taken and considered reasonably.
            <b><li>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</li></b>
            <br>I expect to consistently apply myself to this course to a reasonable degree, and to approach the content with enthusiasm and a positive learning mindset. I expect myself to communicate with appropriate staff if there are issues, if I am struggling, or if the content is too easy for me.
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my learning plan for Dev Academy.
          <ol>
          <b><li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li></b>
          <br>My long-term goal is to work as a software developer of some kind, whether that is in websites or web apps, or some other technology. I love programming, and I want my career to include it in some fashion.
          <b><li>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</li></b>
          <br>I am very much a practical learner – I pick up things much faster when I can apply them and test them out. I struggle more with vague theoretical things and long form text/video content, where I usually like breaking it up into pieces to maintain concentration.
          <b><li>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li></b>
          <br>I would like to hone my skills in collaboration and in design. These are areas where my previous jobs have not been as relevant, and I’m keen to ensure I’ve developed more skills in those areas.
          <b><li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
              <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
            </ul>
          </li></b>
          <br>These things are best achieved, in my opinion, through open, respectful communication with others about any problems or concerns.
          <br>
          <br>My commitment is to communicate with facilitators if there are any issues that are of concern. I will ensure I am respectful of others and of their time and views. I make a commitment for my work to be done to a high standard and on time, and to communicate if I am having issues doing so.
          <br>
          <br>When things are building up or getting to me, I have my own support network of friends and family I can rely on, and I will be open about my issues with facilitators and those I am working directly with in order to try and find solutions and ensure they stay in the loop.
          
          <b><li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li></b>
          <br>Initially, I tend to look online for solutions, and I will do so to fix smaller bugs or issues. I will ask any questions I have in the Discord if I can’t find an online solution in a reasonable about of time. If there are more personal issues that will affect my learning I will seek help from a facilitator as soon as I can.
          <b><li>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li></b>
          <br>I expect open communication and feedback about my progress. I also expect fair treatment, respect, and I expect a problem-solving approach to assisting me in my learning, as opposed to an overly rigid approach. I expect reasonable help given where possible and help in finding solutions if they do not have them on hand.
          <b><li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</li></b>
          <br>I have specific medical appointments that may take around 2 hours each. There are three of them, and I am still in the process of hearing back about when exactly these will be, unfortunately. I can try to make these as unobtrusive as possible, but they have to be on weekdays unfortunately. I will let facilitators know when I know more about these.
