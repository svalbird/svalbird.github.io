          This is my learning plan for Dev Academy.
          <ol>
          <b><li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li></b>
          <br>My long-term goal is to work as a software developer of some kind, whether that is in websites or web apps, or some other technology. I love programming, and I want my career to include it in some fashion.
          <b><li>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</li></b>
          <br>I am very much a practical learner – I pick up things much faster when I can apply them and test them out. I struggle more with vague theoretical things and long form text/video content, where I usually like breaking it up into pieces to maintain concentration.
          <b><li>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li></b>
          <br>I would like to hone my skills in collaboration and in design. These are areas where my previous jobs have not been as relevant, and I’m keen to ensure I’ve developed more skills in those areas.
          <b><li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
              <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
            </ul>
          </li></b>
          <br>These things are best achieved, in my opinion, through open, respectful communication with others about any problems or concerns.
          <br>
          <br>My commitment is to communicate with facilitators if there are any issues that are of concern. I will ensure I am respectful of others and of their time and views. I make a commitment for my work to be done to a high standard and on time, and to communicate if I am having issues doing so.
          <br>
          <br>When things are building up or getting to me, I have my own support network of friends and family I can rely on, and I will be open about my issues with facilitators and those I am working directly with in order to try and find solutions and ensure they stay in the loop.
          
          <b><li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li></b>
          <br>Initially, I tend to look online for solutions, and I will do so to fix smaller bugs or issues. I will ask any questions I have in the Discord if I can’t find an online solution in a reasonable about of time. If there are more personal issues that will affect my learning I will seek help from a facilitator as soon as I can.
          <b><li>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li></b>
          <br>I expect open communication and feedback about my progress. I also expect fair treatment, respect, and I expect a problem-solving approach to assisting me in my learning, as opposed to an overly rigid approach. I expect reasonable help given where possible and help in finding solutions if they do not have them on hand.
          <b><li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</li></b>
          <br>I have specific medical appointments that may take around 2 hours each. There are three of them, and I am still in the process of hearing back about when exactly these will be, unfortunately. I can try to make these as unobtrusive as possible, but they have to be on weekdays unfortunately. I will let facilitators know when I know more about these.
