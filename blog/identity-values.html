        <h2>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h2>

          These are a look my my identity, core values, and strengths.
          <ol>
            <b><p><li>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</li></b>
            I once covered up my test because I knew someone was cheating off of it. I could have let him cheat, but I decided that it wasn’t okay. I am happy with my decision as I hope it encouraged him to cheat less.</p>
            <b><p><li>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</li></b>
            My family and friends have heavily shaped my values and identity. Things like honesty, diligence, and respect have been important values that have been shaped by them specifically.</p>
            
            <b><p><li>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</li></b>
            My strengths are my ability to assess problems in a structured way, and my ability to seek out and quickly pick up new skills when I need them. These will allow me to better approach assignments and learn from them, and to become familiar with he tools and resources I will need in this career.</p>
            <b><p><li>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</li></b>
            I have struggled previously with effective time management. This coule negatively impact my learning – however, I am aware of this problem and I am using this as an opportunity to practise effectively prioritising my time.</p>
            
            <b><p><li>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</li></b>
            In my previous job, I needed some important information from a scientist. He was not very good at providing detailed and understandable answers, however, which made communication difficult and slow. I prompted him with more complex and specific questions, and I also arranged for an in-person meeting instead of emails. This worked well. However, I wish now I had also gotten him to provide more external resources so I could better engage with the complex concepts he was discussing.</p>
