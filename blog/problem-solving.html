          Hello, non-tech friend! It’s time for stories about problem solving methods and my experiences!
          <br><b>What’s a time you were blocked on a simple problem?</b>
          <br>Recently, I was coding a game. It’s a little rhythm game, and you make a little blocker block orbs in time with the music. I wanted the blocker to rotate when you pressed a direction, so it was always perpendicular to the direction (y’know, like a barrier).
          <br>It took me two and a half hours to find out how to do this.
          <br>It wasn’t unfamiliarity with the language or the program or anything. I looked everywhere for this online in forums. I read documentation. I made sure to write out the code to do this (it was one line, to be fair). I asked a friend, who was also a bit confused. Finally, I found the issue.
          <br>I was using the word rotate instead of rotation.
          <br>I felt dumb at the end, but it was valuable to know. Sometimes it’s the little stuff, and a lot of time was spent seeing if my approach was bad versus the little misspellings and bugs. I learned that it’s worth double checking the little stuff before seeing if the whole approach was bad.
          <br><b>What’s a time you elegantly solved a problem?</b>
          <br>In a recent challenge I solved a challenge in one line – using a special function called a map function. The challenge was to take sets of numbers and figure out if they were divisible by other numbers. I wrote code that sorted one number, then used one line to generalize it out to any set of numbers. I used pseudocode and process mapping to plan out what was going to happen, and then I realised that I could do several steps at once. I was very happy, and I learned that it’s possible to combine steps in a process with precise tools sometime.
          <br><b>How confident are you with these problem solving techniques?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode – I love pseudocode, though I tend to combine this with process flow diagrams (boxes and arrows) to visualise everything better. Not a huge fan of long lists of pseudocode, but HUGE fan of the same thing in boxes/arrows. Chemical engineer brain, I guess.</li>
            <li>Trying something – ALWAYS, I can’t emphasize that enough. Every challenge I’ve done I’ve probably approached at least two different ways. I love experimenting and using new tools or different approaches because it can be elegant and it’s a great way to pick up a diverse set of tools.</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method – I find this isn’t that different to how I think anyway, so it’s not super helpful for me unfortunately. Having a less knowledgeable person to bounce things off of can sometimes be good, because they can pick up on obvious stuff I’ve missed on occasion.</li>
            <li>Reading error messages – Useful more often that not, but not super consistent. I think I’ll get better at this as I get better at coding and certain languages in general.</li>
            <li>Console.logging – I do this CONSTANTLY, it’s an amazing tool as it provides dynamic insight into problems (and it’s telling when it doesn’t show up in the console at all). Gotta be careful about how the function treats data types sometimes though!</li>
            <li>Googling – Again, CONSTANTLY. If the problem is abstract or hyperspecific it’s not super helpful, but it’s great for stuff I’m learning.</li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help – Useful if I’ve had a crack at solving it myself and I’m stuck.</li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help – Useful, but only after I’m out of options (though I live with a software dev who works with web apps so I often ask him if I’m really really stuck first)</li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection – Reflection can feel slow and pointless to me. I know it’s helpful in solidifying understanding and what works, but I’m a very “try everything and onto the next thing” kind of person when problem solving, so it’s an area I could improve on.</li>
